                <h2>Serving Home and Community:<br />Women of Southern Appalachia</h2>
                <p>Ravenswood, Ivanhoe, Pippa Passes, Cherokee—the picturesque place names of the southern Appalachian
                    highlands can belie the harsh realities of daily life in these hills. In a land of coal mines and
                    company towns, the women of this lovely but isolated region have faced uncommon challenges in their
                    struggles to keep their families, communities, and cultures intact. Many of these women have
                    demonstrated admirable determination and dignity in the midst of unemployment, illness, and natural
                    disaster. Their resourcefulness and perseverance are testaments to the American spirit.</p>
                <p>Serving Home and Community: Women of Southern Appalachia paid tribute to these acts of personal
                    heroism. Some 50 black and white photos by Barbara Beirne show women) of the region who have
                    suffered economic hardships due to mining and agricultural issues and who have had to care for
                    children, grandchildren and sick husbands.  Sometimes pastoral, sometimes bleak, these haunting
                    images of Appalachian towns and countrysides set the environmental stage for the stories told in the
                    portraits.</p>
                <p>Starting in 1992, Beirne traveled the small towns and quiet valleys of Kentucky, North Carolina,
                    Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, photographing and interviewing many of the remarkable women
                    who call this region home. Beirne's richly detailed black-and-white photographs capture the historic
                    struggles and inspirational accomplishments of two generations of Appalachian women, revealing the
                    region's social, racial, and cultural diversity. Each portrait is paired with an excerpt from
                    Barbara Beirne's interviews, allowing each woman to recount her story in her own unique voice.</p>
                <p>Organized by the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History and curated by David Haberstich,
                    head of photographic collections at NMAH's Archives Center, this exhibition toured in nine states
                    from 1999-2003.</p>
                <p>My mother was a domestic, but she taught me I could be anything I wanted to be—if I worked hard
                    enough. Now that I'm a police captain, I want to be a pathfinder for those after me. I would not be
                    where I am today were it not for people like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, and Eleanor
                    Roosevelt.<br />—Ivin Lee, Dunbar, West Virginia, 1996</p>

                                <p>When I was little I lived right down thar in a two room house. We had five or six

                                    a room, but it was the warmest house there ever was.
                                    My Daddy worked on the farm, and Mommy made our coats and dresses. She made our
                                    socks
                                    from the wool after they sheared the sheep.
                                    My Daddy had three or four guns. I was teached what to do.

                                <p>I taught school in Delaware but decided to come home to Kentucky.
                                    In 1977 the coal companies were hiring women right and left, so I decided
                                    to work in the mines. I can make money and I can afford to get what I want and do
                                    what I
                                    want.

                                <p>My parents were missionaries, and my childhood was spent in China. I came to Kentucky
                                    when my
                                    husband was appointed president of Berea College.
                                    I worked twenty-eight years as a pediatrician, and had clinics all over the state.
                                    Many
                                    unprivileged folks had large families, and I introduced them
                                    to family planning. The mothers were so happy they soon sent their teenage daughters
                                    to

                                    children in this house without running water.
                                    We had our good times and our bad times. Men were killed in explosions. There were
                                    strikes,
                                    layoffs, and we were flooded out twice.
                                    We lost everything, but we were a tight community basd on love. Color didn&apos;t
                                    make

                                    don&apos;t want to do nothing.
                                    You got to raise them up right. If you tell children to do something - mean it.

                                <p>My ancestors hid in the mountains so they wouldn&apos;t have to march to Oklahoma
                                    when
                                    the
                                    government drove the Cherokees out of North Carolina.
                                    I think preserving our traditions is essential to our survival as a Cherokee people.
                                    I
                                    teach
                                    the
                                    Cherokee language to our young people.
                                    We are the only tribe with a written language that uses its own alphabet.

                                <p>Me and Amos were married 51 years, but the Lord needed him worse than I did, so He
                                    took
                                    him
                                    away
                                    from me.
                                    I said, &ldquo;Lord you know I&apos;m left alone, but you&apos;re going to stay with
                                    me.
                                    I ain&apos;t doubting you for nothing.&rdquo; I never did feel afraid, and I

                                    going to
                                    give up.
                                    The Lord didn&apos;t come down here and promise me a bed of roses.
                                    Lord have mercy.

                                <p>My mother was a domestic, but she taught me that I could be anything I wanted to be
                                    &mdash; if
                                    I worked hard enough.
                                    Now that I&apos;m a police captain I want to be a pathfinder for those after me. I
                                    would
                                    not be
                                    where I am today were it not for people like Rosa Parks,
                                    Martin Luther King and Eleanor Roosevelt.

                                <p>I grew up on a farm in Wythe County and got my first job teaching when I was 17 years
                                    old.
                                    It was a one-room school. The only water we had was what the kids carried to school
                                    in a
                                    bucket
                                    from a spring somewhere.
                                    I had to build the fires and sweep and everything. It was way back when.

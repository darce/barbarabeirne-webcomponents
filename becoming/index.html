                <p>In many ways, ours is a nation of immigrants—hungry for freedom, peace, and the opportunity promised by the American Dream. The realities of that immigrant experience are most vividly read in the faces and words of young people who have made this journey.</p>
                <p>Faithful to their native cultural traditions, but motivated to create a better life for themselves and their families, teenage immigrants have a unique vantage point from which to remind us what it means, and what it has always meant, to be American.</p>
                <p><em>Becoming American: Teenagers and Immigration</em> features 59 riveting black-and-white images of young immigrants by accomplished documentary photographer Barbara Beirne. Each sensitive portrait is paired with excerpts from Beirne’s interviews with teens from Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. All of their stories are unique, and we read in every quote—and in every face—the individual struggles and hopes of “becoming American.”</p>

                                The strongest connection I have with China, my native land, is through my parents.
                                I have seen the pain of leaving their beloved land upon which their memories are deeply
                                rooted.
                                I have seen their struggles to learn the English language and to survive in America.
                                But I have also been witness to their joys of accomplishment.
                                We bring our culture with us and share it. Truly, it has been a bittersweet journey.

                                After the revolution, my parents left Iran because they could not practice their
                                Bah&aacute;&apos;&iacute;
                                faith.
                                I&apos;m sixteen years old and my parents are still really protective. They live in a
                                country
                                that is strange to them.
                                I have an 11:30 curfew, and I can&apos;t stay overnight at anyone&apos;s house.
                                Now after the terrible events at the World Trade Center, I&apos;m worried that we are
                                going
                                to
                                have a war. I&apos;m also afraid that all Arab people will be suspected of terrorism.

                                My mother and father both left El Salvador because of the war. My parents met in America
                                and
                                got
                                married. I am glad I live in America because El Salvador is a very poor country and
                                it&apos;s
                                almost impossible to find a well paying job.
                                When we visit San Salvador, we cannot go out at night because of the organized gangs.
                                At

                                you can hear gunshots. My family is happy and proud to live in America, the land of the

                                In my country, it was always war. I saw people dying. I saw peole without arms, eyes,
                                hands
                                &mdash; without heads.
                                I was scared. My country, Kosovo, is not a strong country.
                                We finally got away, but I was upset. I left my family in my country. I left my stuff.
                                We went to Macedonia to a [refugee] camp, then to Fort Dix in New Jersey, then Arizona.
                                We
                                went
                                back to Kosovo,
                                but there were no jobs and no money. There were not even roads. We left again for
                                California.

                                We came to America so my brother and I could get a good education. In the Dominican
                                Republic, schools are very expensive.
                                in fact, everything is expensive even though the economy is very bad.
                                My family visits our relatives in the DR often, and I&apos;m very proud of my
                                heritage.

                                people are friendly and it&apos;s part of our tradition to help the poor.
                                I try very hard to be concerned about people who have problems.

                                If your question is, why in the heck do Mexicans and other Latinos come to live in our
                                country?
                                The answer is simple. Change!
                                In most Latin American countries, there are no benefits and you cannot receive a good
                                and stable
                                salary.
                                There are many jobs here in Wyoming.
                                Almost everyone works two or three jobs. My mother is a housekeeper and a waitress. I
                                think
                                Americans should try to better understand immigrants.
                                Communities could try to share their traditions, culture, and life with us.

                                remarkable opportunity to be involved in a traditional Indian lifestyle.
                                Our place of worship, the Sri Venkateswara Temple, is an important part of my spiritual
                                life. I
                                particularly love the Indian classical dance called Kuchipudi which often tells the
                                tales of
                                the
                                gods and goddesses in Indian culture.

                                If I still lived in Cuba, I would probably be in jail, because I feel that it is most
                                important
                                for an artist to have freedom of expression. In Cuba, the government encourages artists
                                to
                                only
                                paint pro-revolutionary subjects or portraits of Fidel Castro.
                                Any subject that questions the government could be dangerous for the artist, family, and
                                even
                                friends. Here I can paint anything I choose. Recently, the subject of my paintings has
                                been
                                war
                                and its affect on people&apos;s spirit and being.
                                I want to investigate important subjects.

                                My mother has her own business - an African braiding shop. I come here to help after
                                school.
                                It&apos;s so hard to move to a new country. I really miss my freinds and Guinea&apos;s
                                warm
                                weather. I miss not being able to speak French, and most of all, I miss my grandma.
                                What surprised me about this country is that in the city where I live there are so many
                                homeless
                                people. How could this happen in America?

                                Most of my life I have lived in America. But I stil feel I&apos;m Japanese. I love
                                Japanese
                                culture, and I&apos;ll probably go back there to live someday.
                                It&apos;s been lucky for me that I&apos;ve been able to study music in America. In
                                Japan
                                the
                                emphasis is on technique, and you can never make a mistake.
                                In this country, you are encouraged to be yourself.
                                It makes music more enjoyable. I have two tubas, and their names are Nadia and Gina.
                                They
                                will
                                have to be my girlfriends for a while - until I have time for the real thing.

                                My family left Guatemala four years ago. We now live in a neighborhood that&apos;s all
                                Spanish,
                                but it is still very different than home.
                                In my town, people spend a lot of time outside. Here it&apos;s very quiet, and you
                                don&apos;t
                                get to know many people. My grandfather was a farmer, but I want to be an auto mechanic.
                                I don&apos;t think it should be so hard to get your papers here. It can take up to ten
                                years
                                which really causes a lot of problems.

                                In Cambodia, students do not study, because even if you have a higher education you do
                                not
                                make
                                good money. The government does not pay the people well.
                                Also the justice system is not working. People rob each other, and there are many
                                kidnappings.
                                You have to pay a lot of money to get your child back.
                                We came here to find a safe place. Our life in America is very different. We already
                                have a
                                grocery store.

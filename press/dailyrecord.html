                <p>Irwing Bernel was 13 when he and Barbara Beirne of Morristown walked the Wyoming
                    landscape, she with her camera in hand. The Mexican teenager told her the first thing he
                    learned to say in English: "Will you be my friend?" Bernel was eager to be understood,
                    much
                    like the other 58 teenagers Beirne photographed for her exhibit "Becoming American:
                    Teenagers and Immigration." The black-and-white exhibit, part of the Smithsonian Institution
                    Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), is making its first stop at Ellis Island Immigration Museum
                    now through June 3. From there, it continues to Chicago, and then onward on a four-year
                    journey across the country. (To see more of the photos, visit <a href="http://www.barbarabeirne.com">www.barbarabeirne.com</a>.) </p>

                <p>With the photograph of each teenager — some from Morris County — is a short essay or poem
                    written by the teen about his or her experience. Bernel's last line stayed with Beirne:
                    "Communities could try to share traditions, culture and life with us." "What a mature
                    thing for a
                    13-year-old boy to say," said the documentary photographer, who traveled to city and
                    countryside in 11 states from New Jersey to California. The immigrants of yesteryear tended
                    toward cities, she said, but today that is not necessarily true. Bernel, for instance, lives in the
                    wide-open West. As she did with all her subjects, Beirne asked him what backdrop best suited
                    him for an environmental portrait. He chose the Tetons.</p>

                <p>"They are all teenagers searching for their identity as Americans," Beirne said, "but
                    with the
                    added dimension of learning the language and struggling with trying to belong." The desire to
                    be
                    understood is what inspired most to participate, according to Beirne. She was after chronicling
                    the modern immigration experience. "This is about putting faces on immigration," she said.
                    "We
                    talk about immigration policy but not enough about immigrants." In a fast-moving world, still
                    photography allows people the luxury of long looks and the opportunity to ponder what they see,
                    according to Beirne.</p>

                <p>Photographing in black and white is one of her hallmarks. She likes echoing the work of the
                    social photographers of the earlier 20th century. Dorothea Lange. Lewis Hine. Walker Evans,
                    who worked with writer James Agee on the classic "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men," about
                    conditions among white sharecropper families in the U.S. South. Theirs were photographs that
                    raised consciousness and influenced lawmakers and attitudes. As student and teacher, Beirne
                    works with and among big names in her field. She holds a master's degree in fine arts with an
                    emphasis in photography from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. She studied with Robert Mapplethorpe
                    and Lisette Model and, in the early 1990s, taught photography at County College of Morris, a
                    program she praises. Only "Belfast," her Ireland project, was photographed in color. She
                    could
                    not resist. "Oh, the colors in Ireland," said Beirne, whose ancestry is Irish.</p>

                <p>While developing the project she thought of the prejudices the Irish faced when they came to
                    the United States. "We need to ask ourselves now, Are we more welcoming to immigrants than
                    we have been before? Do we have an appreciation of what they go through?" The questions
                    first occurred to her in 1999 while on assignment at Fort Dix for a New Jersey magazine. There
                    she photographed Kosovar Albanian refugees who had been living in a camp in Macedonia as
                    they arrived by airlift. They stayed at Fort Dix until resettlement agencies found proper places
                    for them. Because the children often spoke some English, Beirne found herself connecting to
                    them. As she watched each leave, she pondered how they would adapt to life in this country. So
                    "Becoming American" was born.</p>

                <p>Her hope is it will encourage Americans to ponder the same questions. Participating in the
                    project helped some teenagers process their own lives. Johnnie Sciortino of Morris Plains,
                    whose Argentinian parents own the Swiss Chalet Bakery in Morristown, was photographed for
                    "Becoming American." "She took a picture of me working in the decorators'
                    department," said
                    Sciortino, now a 21-year-old business student at County College of Morris. He is second-
                    generation American, as are some of the other 59 subjects. though most are first generation.
                    Sciortino said life is different for him at 21 than it was for his father, Angelo, at the same age.
                    "My father came here at 18, not speaking English," Sciortino said. "He did not have
                    much
                    money. He was single, worked three jobs, lived in an apartment, sent money back home."
                    During a short visit to Argentina, Angelo Sciortino met his wife, Antonia, and returned to the
                    United States to work and save enough to have her join him. "If he didn't do what he did, I
                    wouldn't have the opportunities I have at this moment -- going to college, being educated, being
                    a U.S. citizen," Sciortino said. "I learned determination from my father and courage from
                    my
                    mother. If my parents could do what they did, I know I can do anything if I put my mind to it."

                    Other Morris teens photographed for the exhibit include Eileen Glaraga from the Philippines and
                    formerly of Dover, as well as Omar Garcia from Colombia, formerly of Morristown. There are
                    others from elsewhere in New Jersey:

                    All their stories are what the Smithsonian is about. "The Smithsonian is America's
                    museum,"
                    said Lawrence Hyman, project director for SITES, which has 50 exhibits traveling the country at
                    any given time. They are for Americans who cannot get to the museums in Washington, D.C.
                    "Becoming American" is not Beirne's first exhibit for the Smithsonian. "Serving
                    Home and
                    Community: Women of Southern Appalachia" appeared in the National Museum of American
                    History and also traveled with SITES. "Barbara has a wonderful eye," Hyman said, "and
                    with her

                    camera she tells the kind of American stories the Smithsonian collects and interprets." The
                    story
                    of immigration certainly is a large part of the American experience, he said. An experience key
                    to the ever-changing fabric of the United States.

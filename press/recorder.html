                <p> Immigration has become a hot topic in the United States. Some feel that people standing on street
                    corners or at railroad stations waiting for work have no right to be there and should all be shipped
                    off to their native lands. Others feel that immigration has contributed to the greatness of our
                    nation, and that our immigration policies are cruel and insensitive and need to be drastically
                    revised.</p>
                <p> Through her photographic lens, Morris Township photographer Barbara Beirne has recorded with
                    sensitivity and insight the anguish and the hope of a group of first generation teenagers, those who
                    have immigrated to this country or refugees who have been forced to leave their native land, in her
                    exhibition &quot;Becoming American: Teenagers and Immigration.&quot; This traveling exhibition of 59 black and
                    white photographs organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) is
                    currently on view at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum, Ellis Island, New York through June 3 and
                    is then expected to travel around the United States for four years.</p>
                <p> Beirne, who specializes in documentary photography has succeeded in putting a human face on
                    immigration, capturing the uncertainty and courage of these young teenagers faced with the
                    challenges of adapting to a new world and culture. The project all started in 1999 when Beirne was
                    on assignment for NJ Magazine to photograph and interview Albanian refugees from Kosovo, sent to
                    Fort Dix, New Jersey before being relocated in the United States. &quot;I became so interested in the
                    young newcomers that I decided to pursue the subject of refugee and immigrant teenagers to explore
                    the difficulties and triumphs they experienced while trying to adapt to this country,&quot; said Beirne
                    in a recent interview.</p>
                <p> Beirne contacted a friend at the Grand Street Settlement on the lower East side of New York City, a
                    nonprofit organization that has provided services to immigrants since 1916, to get permission to
                    start her project. &quot;I met with potential subjects and together we discussed how to proceed with
                    the project. The teenagers decided where they wanted to be photographed, what they would wear and
                    what they wanted to write about themselves to accompany the photographs.&quot;</p>
                <p> From these initial photographs Beirne extended her project, traveling to 11 different states between
                    2000 and 2006, to study immigrants and refugees in high schools, places of worship and refugee
                    resettlement centers across the country. &quot;In my travels and work I was very impressed with the
                    agencies that help refugees assimilate, such as the International Rescue Committee (IRC). They do a
                    wonderful job of guiding, comforting and advising these young people as they struggle to learn
                    English and adapt to new customs.&quot;</p>
                <p> In one photograph, strikingly beautiful Nidhi V. Pamidimukkala, age 16 at the time she was
                    photographed, wears a tradition Indian headdress and looks over her shoulder at the viewer as she
                    stands in front of the magnificent Hindu temple the Sri Venkateswara Temple in Bridgewater, New
                    Jersey, which dominates the background. In her statement Nidhi writes &quot;It has been a challenge to
                    balance and assimilate into my American culture while maintaining my Indian roots and background.
                    I&apos;m a typical teenage girl who loves to go to the mall with friends; however, I have the remarkable
                    opportunity to be involved in a traditional Indian lifestyle. Our place of worship, the Sri
                    Venkateswara Temple is an important part of my spiritual life&hellip;&quot; To emphasize the importance of the
                    Temple, Beirne photographs Nidhi in the foreground in sharp focus, while she softens the outlines of
                    the massive structure of the Temple, adding a spiritual quality to the photograph.</p>
                <p> Tension is vividly portrayed in the photograph of a young Iranian Sohale Mehrmanesh from Elmwood
                    Park, who is depicted seated on a sofa looking at the viewer with dark piercing eyes, his large
                    hands featured prominently clasped tensely on his lap. Sohale reflects the worries of many young
                    refugees from Iran. &quot;After the revolution, my parents left Iran because they could not practice
                    their Baha&apos;i faith. I&apos;m sixteen years old and my parents are still really protective&hellip;. I have an
                    11:30 pm curfew, and I can&apos;t stay overnight at anyone&apos;s house. Now after the terrible events at the
                    World Trade Center, I&apos;m worried that we are going to have a war. I&apos;m also afraid that all Arab
                    people will be suspected of terrorism.&quot;</p>
                <p> A portrait of a 15 year old African refugee Diana Ingabire now living in Chicago shows her seated
                    head held high with pride and dignity. In her statement, she describes her experiences after fleeing
                    the Congo to go live in Zambia. After a long bus trip and many days walking to Zambia, she and her
                    family found no refugee camps there and were forced to live on the street. Yet, Diana&apos;s story is one
                    of hope. &quot;My brothers and I were not allowed to go to school because we were foreigners. I played
                    with friends all day until we came to America. Now I can go to school. This country is good.&quot;</p>
                <p> In another image, Marcial Ramos from Union City stands proudly near his painting of midieval knights
                    preparing for battle. &quot;If I still lived in Cuba, I would probably be in jail, because I feel that it
                    is most important for an artist to have freedom of expression,&quot; Marcial explained in his statement.
                    &quot;In Cuba, the government encourages artists to only paint pro-revolutionary subjects or portraits of
                    Fidel Castro. Any subject that questions the government could be dangerous for the artist, family,
                    and even friends. Here I can paint anything I choose&hellip;.&quot;</p>
                <p> Beirne a project-oriented photographer has lived all her life in New Jersey, growing up in
                    Bloomfield. She received an MAF in photography from Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, and studied with
                    Robert Mapplethorpe and Lisette Model. &quot;Mapplethorpe taught me how to use light effectively,&quot; Beirne
                    said. She has completed three other projects including: Children of Belfast, Northern Ireland; The
                    Community Food Bank of Morris County; and most recently Serving Home and Community: Women of
                    Southern Appalachia, which was also a traveling exhibition organized by SITES. She taught for 5
                    years as an adjunct professor of photography at County College of Morris in Randolph and has
                    authored 4 children&apos;s books: &quot;Siobhan&apos;s Journey;&quot; &quot;Riders Up!,&quot; &quot;Children of the Ecuadorian
                    Highlands;&quot; and &quot;Pianist&apos;s Debut.&quot; Her camera of choice is a medium format camera, so that she can
                    make large 16 by 20 prints. Beirne develops her negatives and prints the images herself. &quot;Each
                    step is an important part of the creative process,&quot; Beirne said.</p>
                <p> Her photographs have a wonderful quality of light, and she often frames her images to create
                    exciting compositions. The play of dark and light in her photographs is magnificent and used to
                    highlight the special personality of each individual. &quot;The teenagers in this exhibition have the
                    determination and strength always associated with those who are courageous enough to leave their
                    homelands and all that is familiar to them. They struggle to &quot;be themselves&quot; while seeking tolerance
                    and understanding from their adopted homeland. I am confident that with time and encouragement these
                    your people will realize their American Dream,&quot; Beirne wrote.</p>

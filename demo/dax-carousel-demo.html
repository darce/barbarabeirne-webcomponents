            <p>My parents were missionaries, and my childhood was spent in China. I came to Kentucky
              when my
              husband was appointed president of Berea College.
              I worked twenty-eight years as a pediatrician, and had clinics all over the state. Many
              unprivileged folks had large families, and I introduced them
              to family planning. The mothers were so happy they soon sent their teenage daughters to
              me
              for
              advice.
